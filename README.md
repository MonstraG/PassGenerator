### PassGenerator

Allows generating strong rememberable passwords.

You're supposed to generate a *password to your password manager*.

Generates a CapitalizedPassword using 1 word from second path of 20kWords file and enough words from the first to reach 20 letters.

You should also add a * or & or ^  or smth in the middle of the password, not between the words but in the mi^ddle, to increase alphabet size and significantly decrease brute force chances.

Examples of generated passwords, and how they can be slightly changed to make them strong:
